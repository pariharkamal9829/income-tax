    <h4 align="center"> HISTORY OF TAXATION PRE- 1922</h4>

    <p>"It was only for the good of his subjects that he collected taxes from them, just as the sun draws moisture from the earth to give it back a thousand fold"- --Kalidas in raghuvansh eulogizing  KING DALIP . It is a matter of general belief that taxes on income and worth are of recent origin but there is enough evidence to show that taxes on show that taxes on income in some form or the other level were levied even in primitive and ancient communities. The origin of the word "Tax" is from "Taxation" which means an estimate. These were levied either on the sale and purchase of merchandise or livestock and were collected in a haphazard manner from to time. Nearly 2000 years ago, there went out a decree from Ceaser Augustus 
        that all the world should be taxed  In Greece, Germany and Roman Empires, taxes were also levied sometimes on  the basisof turnover and sometimes on occupations . For many  centuries , revenue from taxes went to the Monarch. In Northern England, taxes were levied on land and on moveable property such as the Saladin title in 1188 . Later on, these were collected by introduction of poll taxes, and indirect taxes known as "Ancient Customs" which were duties on wool, leather and hides. These levies and taxes in various forms and on various commodities and professions were imposed to meet the needs of the Government to meet their military and civil expenditure and not only to ensure safety to the subjects but also to meet the
         common needs of the citizens like maintenance of roads, administration of justice and such other functions of the state.In India, the system of direct taxation as it is know today ,has been  in force in one form or another  even from ancient timeThere are references both in Manu Smriti and Arthasastra to a variety of tax measures. Manu , the ancient sage and law-giver stated that the king could levy taxes , According to Sastras.The Wise sage advised taxes should be related to the income and expenditure of the subject. He ,However, cautioned the king against excessive taxation and stated thst both extremes should be avoided namely either complete absence of taxes or exorbitant taxation.
         According to him, The king should arrange the collection of taxes in such a manner that the subjects did not feel the pinch of paying taxes. He laid  down that traders and artisans should pay 1/5th of their profits in silver and gold, while the agriculturists were to pay 1/6th ,1/8th and 1/10th their produce depending upon their circumstances.The detailed analysis given by Manu on the subject clearly shows the existence of a well planned taxation system, Even in ancient times. Not only this, taxes were also levied on various classes of people like actors, dancers, singers and even dancing girls . Taxes were paid in shape of gold coins, cattle grains, raw-materials and also by rendering personal service.
